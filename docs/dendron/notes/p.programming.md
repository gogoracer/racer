- [x] [Move code into org](https://github.com/gogoracer/racer) 
- [ ] Unified into monorepo.  Go is already modular, if someone doesn't want to use a part of the framework they can.  If there wasn't a huge cost Vue would automatically ship with Router and I18n but the mentality is to break to reduce footprint.  This is almost exclusively backend so the point is moot until proven otherwise.
- [ ] update all naming from hlive
