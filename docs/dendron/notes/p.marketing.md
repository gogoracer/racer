## Change name
Project started as [hlive](https://github.com/SamHennessy/hlive).  While its great to name after liveview and auth initials it doesn't help get people excited.  Originally thought about zippy zap, a quick attack used by Pikachu that is still useful later in the game.  That led to thinking about how really what this could be is a Go version of Rails, but for the frontend.  Its not a big engine on rails, but its a nimble tool to make gophers faster, hence gogoracer. 

## Create an org
- [x] [create an github organization](https://github.com/gogoracer). 

## Logo
Used Midjourney with the prompt
> a gopher that's draw in a style similar to pikachu on a cafe racer motorcycle with yellow lightning coming from its tire
