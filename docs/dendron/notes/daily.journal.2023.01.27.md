## Delaney
Had a great talk with Sam Hennessy, author of hlive.  Seemed very interested in taking hlive further.  It appears he have stalled out as the current hlive fits his needs.  My needs appear to be much more in the real time dashboard and so need extra tool he hasn't thought about yet.  I talked about my concern with overstepping and he said "Please feel to overstep", so I'm going full bore.
